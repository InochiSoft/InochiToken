# Inochi Labs

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat run --network testnet scripts/deploy-ledger-profile.ts
npx hardhat verify --network testnet 0x2b3DD1049c4b312EBbbd583f3741393d5285c879
```
